# GraduateProjects

Projects developed as part of my Computer Science Graduate Coursework.

# Android
# Math's Tutor App - 
- It is a simple Android App for kids to test their knowledge with basic math operations. 
- It includes questions related to basic operations Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication.
- Based on the user's answers a score report is provided.
- Used Android Studio to build the App.

# Data Visualization
Medicaid Covered OTC Drugs NADAC price Trends -
- Developed a web based interactive visualization that assists to understand the NADAC price trends for OTC drugs for different categories over 2013 - 2020, the       drug category with highest and lowest NADAC price in a particular year, get the NADAC price for a particular drug name.
- NADAC is the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, For my project, I have extracted only the common Over the counter (OTC) drugs which
  are covered under Medicaid. These includes the â€“ Analgesics, Cough Cold, Antidiarrheal, Vitamins, Decongestant, Sore Throat Drugs categories
- Used D3 JS framework, HTML, CSS, NADAC dataset to build the interactive webpage.

# iOS
Image Classification using CoreML Machine Learning Framework
- Developed a small demo iOS application for the usage of CoreML Machine Learning Framework to classify the fruit images.
- Integrated the ML model into SwiftUI App. Used a simple UI that shows a single fruit image to user and once user selects Classfiy button they will get the           predicted name for the image by the ML model. 
- Used the CoreML's Image classifcation model - MobileNetV2 which is a  prebuilt and pretrained ML model, Xcode to develop the ImageClassifier App.
